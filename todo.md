- [x] Ensure both scenarios follow JSON schema: trigger, route, action, expected_observation, resolution, wms_return_logic, instructor_script
- [x] UI: clear action panel + clear explanation panel + clear validation/confirmation step
- [x] FR/EN bilingual support for all new scenario text
- [x] Run pnpm build (0 errors, 2707kB bundle) and pnpm test (218/218)
- [x] Save checkpoint and push to GitHub

- [x] Save checkpoint and push to GitHub

## ScenarioPanel Guided Discovery Refactor

- [x] Rewrite ScenarioPanel.tsx: collapsed alert banner (default) → Step 1 (Odoo task, no explanation) → Step 2 (reveal explanation + root cause) → Step 3 (written answer required before confirm)
- [x] Collapsed state: small amber banner "⚠️ Situation détectée (optionnel)" + short hint + "Vérifier dans Odoo" button
- [x] Step 1: show ONLY Odoo instructions + where to look + 1 discovery question (no explanation)
- [x] Step 2: reveal after user types first input (≥10 chars) — show explanation, root cause, correction
- [x] Step 3: require non-empty written answer before enabling confirmation button
- [x] Do NOT block normal WMS transaction flow (scenario is always optional/collapsible)
- [x] Teacher script section: hidden by default, collapsible accordion
- [x] Bilingual FR/EN support maintained across all 3 steps

- [x] Design SCN-001: Positive baseline (GR posted correctly, stock visible) — Réception conforme
- [x] Design SCN-002: GR not posted (receipt in READY, stock = 0) — Réception fantôme
- [x] Design SCN-003: Stock issue (quantity mismatch between PO and GR) — Marchandise mal rangée (putaway incomplete)
- [x] Design SCN-004: Inventory mismatch (physical vs system discrepancy) — Écart de quantité (PO/GR mismatch)
- [x] Design SCN-005: Multi-error (hidden receipt + wrong lot + negative stock chain) — Erreur en cascade
- [x] Validate all 5 scenarios against real Odoo data (SKU-001, SKU-004, BOX-001)
- [x] Implement all 5 in ScenarioPanel registry with 3-step guided UX
- [x] Wire each SCN to correct M1 step in StepForm.tsx (GR, GR, PUTAWAY_M1, GI, COMPLIANCE)

- [x] Design Teacher Trigger (FR + EN) for SCN-003: tension around "goods received but cannot be picked"
- [x] Design Teacher Trigger (FR + EN) for SCN-004: tension around "supplier invoice blocked, no one knows why"
- [x] Design Teacher Trigger (FR + EN) for SCN-005: tension around "period close tomorrow, system is not clean"
- [x] Design Teacher Trigger (FR + EN) for SCN-M2-001: tension around "wrong lot shipped to customer"
- [x] Design Teacher Trigger (FR + EN) for SCN-M3-001: tension around "delivery impossible, stock shows negative"
- [x] Design Teacher Trigger (FR + EN) for SCN-M4-001: tension around "KPI dashboard shows red, no one can explain why"
- [x] Design Teacher Trigger (FR + EN) for SCN-M5-001: tension around "old receipt still open, audit is tomorrow"
- [x] Add teacher_trigger + teacher_triggerEn fields to ScenarioConfig TypeScript interface
